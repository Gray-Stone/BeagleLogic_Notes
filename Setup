Init Notes:
  Beagle bone is not like raspberry pi. By default, it does not have video output, 
  Things are connected through usb (eathernet over USB).
  It come with a image flashed onto the onboard eMMC (4G). So it can boot without SD card. 
  
  Currently using BBBW with v4.9 come perinstalled. 

Step1: Getting BeagleLogic to work:
  
  * Go to https://beaglelogic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html and get the system image. 
  * Burn the image into a sd card, and insert that to beaglebone
  * Hold user button (one on USB-A side) then plug in power. 
    note: if pwd led is flashing, might be not enough power or something. 
    Try connect both barrel jack (5V only) and usb micro at the same time.  
  * Solid blue pwd led means we are good. 
  
  * wait a bit - - - - - - - - - - -
  * a folder show pop up and a network device should show up 
      (it emulate a storage and a eathernet port under microA connector)
      (under windows, It is a eathernet pluged in with name: unreconized network) 
  * If using Windows, try 192.168.7.2. beaglebone homepage pop up means connection is good and it's running. 
  * try 192.168.7.2:4000. If beaglelogic page show up, Means everything is working

Step2: Get WIFI !!!!
  * SSH into BBBW through eathernet over usb or serial (GPIO). 
  * use connmanctl to config wifi 
      Example: https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/2017/how-to-setup-wifi-on-the-beaglebone-black-wireless
              https://www.fis.gatech.edu/how-to-configure-bbw-wifi/
              
  * Then the device could be accessed wirelessly. 
  
Step3: Get CMD setup (or not)
  * install what ever your favourite combo for cmd. 
  
  
Step4: Try to get thing show up under sigrok and pulseview.
